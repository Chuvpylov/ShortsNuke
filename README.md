# YouTube Shorts Blocker - No More Tiny Tales

## What is This Sorcery? üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the *YouTube Shorts Blocker* ‚Äî the magic wand for those who prefer their videos like their epic novels: long, immersive, and not over in a snap. In the vast ocean of content that is YouTube, Shorts come like waves... small, fast, and many. If you find yourself drowning in these teeny-tiny tidbits when you're fishing for the full-length catches, you've docked at the right port.

## Why Use This? ü§î

You know those little video snacks called YouTube Shorts? They‚Äôre like the fast food of the video world: quick, addictive, and before you know it, you've binged on a hundred of them and wasted away your afternoon. Our extension puts you on a Shorts diet, effectively blocking these tempting morsels so you can stay focused on the gourmet full-length videos you came for.

## How Does It Work? üõ†

Our crafty code hunts down anything with a whiff of "Shorts" on YouTube and makes it vanish faster than a packet of cookies at a diet club. It's like a content censor for your own good. Just install the extension and watch those pesky Shorts disappear, as if by magic. 

## Features ‚ú®

- **Abracadabra Algorithm**: Utilizes mystical spells (aka JavaScript functions) to seek and hide Shorts.
- **Stealth Mode**: Operates quietly in the background. No capes or top hats needed.
- **Shelf, Guide, Mini-Guide**: Clears out Shorts from all nooks and crannies. We're thorough like that.

1. Clone this repository of anti-Shorts wizardry.
2. Load it as an unpacked extension in your browser (we trust you know the drill).
3. Navigate to YouTube and experience the joy of a Shorts-free existence.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This extension is not meant to offend the creators of Shorts or those who enjoy them. It's simply a tool for those who prefer their video content tall, not venti.
